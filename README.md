Description
-----------
Spotless Mind allows you to scan an external harddrive, in order to access later the list of files without needing to use that harddrive. It also record some metadata informations for video files (I loves movies!), such as the definition, and audio/subtitles languages available.

Launch
------
On Linux, enter `./LAUNCH.sh` in a terminal.

Dependencies
------------
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt4   # GUI
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install pymediainfo         # video metadata analysis
```
